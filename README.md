## Programming projects for advanced beginners

I'm working through Robert Heaton's [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/).

I'm sticking all the work in this repo. Each directory is for a different project, with a dedicated README contained within.
